Positive labels mean the user visited/converted on the advertiser website during the test period (2 weeks). The global treatment ratio is 84.6%. It is usual that advertisers keep only a small control population as it costs them in potential revenue.  \n  \nFollowing is a detailed description of the features:  \n  \n- f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11: feature values (dense, float)\n- treatment: treatment group (1 = treated, 0 = control)\n- conversion: whether a conversion occured for this user (binary, label)\n- visit:
